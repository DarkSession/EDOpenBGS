# Elite Dangerous - Project Name 'Open BGS'

## Idea
- Web based application to track BGS and squadron BGS activities
- Tracking is based on the Frontier 'CAPI' journal import
- By default, squadron members can only see BGS activites within their own squadron
- Squadrons are able to exchange/share their activities which each other
- Public instance available for everyone, private instance can be self-hosted by each squadron
- Activites can be share cross-instance, i.e. a squadron using the public instance can still share their activities with a squadron using a private instance
